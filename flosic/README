   FLOSIC 0.1 is now available to CMU. For the purpose of 
testing, I want you to use it first for the systems that 
you have already done. Let us know about its performance- 
accuracy as well as timings.
   FLOSIC0.0 is the 0.0 version of the Fermi Orbital Self 
Interaction Correction Code created in 2017 by introducing 
SIC into one of UTEP-NRLMOL versions (Yoh). The perfect 
version by Mark was used as a reference. It is extensively 
tested and reproduces published FLOSIC numbers (perfect 
code). A number of routines were optimized during the 
development.
   FLOSIC 0.1 is an upgrade to FLOSIC0.0 code. A number 
of loops have been rewritten and are now computed using 
LAPACK routines (Carlos). Major upgrade is a second level 
of parallelization (Luis). The SIC potentials and 
corresponding matrices are built using groups in parallel. 
This allows large number of processors to be used. To use 
this feature create a file called "igroup" as follows
    20 Number of groups
    24 Number of processors per group
In this case, user should request total 480 processors 
(=20*24) in job script. We can give a short tutorial via 
Skype. We will also present scaling information. It should 
be particularly efficient for systems containing  upto 
200 electrons.  


Compilation Instruction

1. Open Makefile and edit the following sections.
 # COMPILERS
 CC = cc    (C compiler)
 FC = ftn   (Fortran MPI compiler)
 FFF = ftn  (Fortran MPI compiler)

 # COMPILER FLAGS
 CFLAGS = -O3
 FFLAGS = -dynamic -mcmodel=medium
 LFLAGS = -dynamic -mcmodel=medium

 # COMPILING OPTIONS
 OPTIONS = -DMPI -DGROUP  
 (Add -DMPI to run MPI calculation and add 
  -DGROUP in addition to run group calculation.) 

 # LINKING OPTIONS
        $(FFF) $(LFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(BIN)

2. Type "make -f Makefile" to compile the code.

3. You have a binary file named "nrlmol_exe."

Optional. To generate Doxygen documentation, run
"make doc."
