electronic_geometry_lbfgs.f

    • Modified to introduce fix1s (constraint to keep 1s FOD positions fixed) under 3 conditions:
    i) If FOD_OPT3V=1 in NRLMOL_INPUT.DAT file
    ii) If the species are not hydrogen atoms.
    iii) If the distance between the atomic position and the 1s FOD is less than 0.1 Bohr
    • Modified to introduce the scaling of FOD forces and gradients if FOD_OPT3V=”Y”
    • Modified to reset LBFGS, if it is stuck. 
    • Allows FOD optimizations that are constrained by symmetry. Symmetry operations are entered in FRMGRP; FOD positions that are symmetry independent are entered in FRMIDT. 
    • Works when  FOD_LOOPV     = 'N', or FOD_LOOPV     = 'Y'. 

wffrm.f

    • Modified to express the grid origin, basis vector coordinates, atomic positions, and electronic density in consistent Angstrom units in the WFFRMIXX files (“XX” is the FLO number)
    • WFFRMIXX can be copied to WFFRMIXX.cube and read by Vesta, JMOL, or other cube file viewers.
